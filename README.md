# To-do list - a React Demonstration

## Prerequisites
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installing node.js from the link on the left will install both of these.
- [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) doesn't need to be installed globally but can make some things easier: `npm install -g gulp`

## How to get going
- Clone the repo locally.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- To start a local server with webpack, use `npm run start`
- By default it runs on port 3001 but this can be changed as desired in `package.json`.

## It can...
- Look pretty
- Show the bare structure of a very rudimentary to-do list
- Do nothing else
 
## Tasks
- Toggle task (demo)
- Remove task
- Add new task, includes adding a new component
